# Chatbot-with-IBMWatsonAssistant
Chatbot is a method allowing the user to have a conversation with an automatic responde. A simple chatbot was created in which it was added to one of the designed website to control a specific robot. The following points summarize the points added:

Information about the designer: the name, major, and skills of the designer will be displayed. For support, a link of the designer's works (drawing) will also be displayed since it was hard to display some of the work in the chat itself. ( https://danaadel9.wixsite.com/website-2)
Information about the website: The purpose of the website will be demonstrated.
Information about robots: General information about robots will be shown and a link of the designer's work can also be seen. (https://github.com/DanaAlesmael)
Controlling a robot: this part guids the robot by following a simple path of directions.
